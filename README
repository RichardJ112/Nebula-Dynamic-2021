# Nebula Dynamic 2021

This is a fork of the EBID simualtor Nebula Dynamic created by Jonathan Dingemanse which itself 
is based on the Monte Carlo electron-matter interaction scatterer created by Luc van Kessel of the TU Delft

Original Nebula Documentation can be found here:
https://nebula-simulator.github.io/

-Look to this documentation for the creation of HDF5 material files with YAML text files with CSTOOL via ELSEPA

As for this repository,
There are two folders inside this distribution: 

nebula_vsc contains the actual simulator and source code which can be compiled by using
the build_nebula_vsc.sh bash script in a linux terminal. To use the simulator add the executable to your PATH. After this you can use 
the desktop_run_alt.sh and desktop_multirun_alt.sh files to run simulations using the command line. Note that you will need to edit these
to properly add the paths to your input parameters.

nebula_test_files contains a folder for the creation,filing and analysis of simulator output through a series of python scripts. In vox_tri_pri 
you can find python scripts for the creation of electron files for various geometries. In the broader file folder output analysis
files can be found. Note that it is necessary to change the paths to various folders/files inside these scripts to those that represent your own local file system.

Note that a python 3 installation, preferably based on the anaconda distribution (https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), will be needed to run the python scripts in
nebula_test_files.

If on a windows platform it is recommended to use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and a supported code editor such as Visual Studio Code (VSC) https://code.visualstudio.com/.
This is a resource link for getting started with this combination for windows: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/get-started-with-windows-subsystem-for-linux/.
You will again need to make sure built executables are added to your path in the .bash_profile and .bashrc files in your linux distribution. These can be found in your installed
linux distribution by typing in \\wsl$ in the windows search bar and navigating to your linux profile.

The necessary command is as follows with your own path to nebula_dynamic_2021.
export PATH=$PATH:/.../nebula_dynamic_2021/nebula_vsc/build/bin

To change some parameters inside the simulator changes should be made to 3 files:

nebula_vsc/source/physics_config.h
-change physics/scattering options

nebula_vsc/source/geometry/voxels.inl
-change gas handling options

nebula_vsc/source/cpu_vsc.cpp
-change location of nebula_test_files on line 217
-change dissociation cross section naming tag line 220

Note that the simulator requires 2 materials for gas handling but you can just use the same material twice with a different name.

Change CMakeLists.txt CMake build type to "Release" for increased speed and to "Debug" in order to allow for breakpoint debugging.
